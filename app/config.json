     * - The third value is the name of the component
     * - The fourth value is for the functionname called from the component
     * - With the third and the fourth values you can manipulate the behaviour of some components
     * - Strings as parameters in functions don't need quotation marks
     * - To see the current value of a function from this game look to the last given value or to
     *   the default value from above
     *
     * IMPORTANT:
     * - Do not use names that aren't in the library
     * - Keep the array clear if it's get bigger
